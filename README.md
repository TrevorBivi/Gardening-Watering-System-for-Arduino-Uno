# Gardening-Watering-System-for-Arduino-Uno
An Arduino Uno program designed to intelligently water different garden sections using resistive soil moisture sensors and internet weather data

While the code in this project should work, I am waiting to build a final version and thoroughly test the system. I will post more information on the build once this project is done.
