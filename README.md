# Gardening-Watering-System-for-Arduino-Uno
An Arduino Uno program designed to intelligently water different garden sections with a rainbarrel as the main water source. Resistive soil moisture sensors and internet weather data is used to decide if the system should water.

This project connects to http://www.convert-unix-time.com/ for unix time data and http://api.openweathermap.org/ for weather data. Open Weather Map _requires you_ to make a free account and include a personal appid when you send http get requests!

While the code in this project should work, I am waiting to build a final version and thoroughly test the system. I will post more information on the build once this project is done.
